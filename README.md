* [Javascript](https://github.com/HamidHeyde/ReactJs/tree/master/Business%20Statistics/JavaScript)
using traditional JavaScript, HTML, CSS, this app has been implemented

* [React](https://github.com/HamidHeyde/ReactJs/tree/master/Business%20Statistics/React)
Through this approach, the same logic has been implemented, without using any dependencies. Using this approach we can easily start developing React application without installing any other dependencins and view the final product through running the index.html
