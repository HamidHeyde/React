* using traditional JavaScript, HTML, CSS, this game has been implemented
#### [React](https://github.com/HamidHeyde/ReactJs/tree/master/TicTacToe/React)
* Using [Create React App]] this game has been implemented [same logic]. In this package react has been deployed along with other dependencies. The application is implemented through App.js, App.css, helpers.js.
#### [React No ES6](https://github.com/HamidHeyde/ReactJs/tree/master/TicTacToe/ReactNoEs6)
* Through this approach, the same logic has been implemented, without using any dependencies. Using this approach we can easily start developing React application without installing anyother dependencins and view the final product through running the index.html
